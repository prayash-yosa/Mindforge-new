### Task 1.1 — API gateway and request validation

**Labels**: Type: Hardening | AI: Non-AI | Risk: Low | Area: Backend — API

**Notes**:
- **As a** backend system  
- **I want** a REST API gateway with request validation and consistent error shape  
- **So that** all clients get validated input and predictable `{ code, message, details? }` and HTTP status (4xx/5xx).  
- **Mode**: V2  
- **Type**: Hardening  
- **Dependencies**: None.  
- **Risks**: None.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] REST API layer accepts HTTPS only; JSON request/response.
- [ ] Request body and query validation in place; invalid input returns 400 and consistent error shape.
- [ ] Error response shape `{ code, message, details? }` for 400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500.
- [ ] Health check endpoint for load balancer.
- [ ] No business or DB logic in API layer; delegates to business layer.

**Estimate**: 2 SP

### Task 1.2 — MPIN verify and token/session issuance

**Labels**: Type: Feature | AI: Non-AI | Risk: Medium | Area: Backend — Auth

**Notes**:
- **As a** student  
- **I want** to enter my 6-digit MPIN and receive a session/token when correct  
- **So that** I can access the app without re-entering MPIN until session expires.  
- **Mode**: V2  
- **Type**: Feature  
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (API gateway); Data layer for students and sessions (can be stubbed for Sprint 1 then wired in Sprint 2).  
- **Risks**: R7 MPIN brute-force — rate limiting and lockout must be implemented; audit failed attempts.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] `POST /auth/mpin/verify` implemented; accepts 6-digit MPIN; validates against stored hash (no MPIN in logs or client).
- [ ] On success: issue short-lived token or session; return token/session (e.g. Bearer); client can use for subsequent requests.
- [ ] On failure: return 401 and clear error message; do not leak whether MPIN or identity was wrong.
- [ ] Rate limiting and lockout policy documented and implemented (e.g. 5 attempts → lockout; per Light Architecture R7).
- [ ] Sensitive operations (failed/success login) written to audit_log.

**Estimate**: 3 SP

---

### Task 1.3 — Lockout status and Forgot MPIN entry points

**Labels**: Type: Feature | AI: Non-AI | Risk: Low | Area: Backend — Auth

**Notes**:

- **Mode**: V2  
- **Type**: Feature  
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.2 (sessions and lockout state).  
- **Risks**: None.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] `POST /auth/lockout/status` returns current lockout state (e.g. locked until timestamp, attempts remaining).
- [ ] `POST /auth/forgot-mpin` initiates recovery (e.g. OTP to registered contact); no implementation of full OTP flow required in v1 if out of scope — endpoint exists and returns 202 or documented behavior.
- [ ] API error shape consistent; 429 or 403 for lockout where appropriate.

**Estimate**: 2 SP

---

### Task 1.4 — Auth middleware and Bearer token validation

**Labels**: Type: Hardening | AI: Non-AI | Risk: Low | Area: Backend — API

### Task 8.3 — Rate limiting and audit logging

**Labels**: Type: Hardening | AI: Non-AI | Risk: Low | Area: Backend — Security

**Notes**:
- **As a** system  
- **I want** rate limiting on auth and critical endpoints and audit log for sensitive operations  
- **So that** we mitigate brute-force and meet compliance.  
- **Mode**: V2  
- **Type**: Hardening  
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.2, 2.1.  
- **Risks**: None.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Rate limiting on `/auth/mpin/verify` (and lockout); optional Redis or in-memory; 429 when exceeded.
- [ ] Audit log: failed/success login, lockouts, sensitive data access; no PII in logs; request id for correlation.

**Estimate**: 2 SP

### Task 8.4 — Monitoring and alerting

**Labels**: Type: Hardening | AI: Non-AI | Risk: Low | Area: DevOps

**Notes**:
- **As a** team  
- **I want** health checks, latency and error metrics, and alerting on 5xx and auth failures  
- **So that** we detect regressions and outages quickly.  
- **Mode**: V2  
- **Type**: Hardening  
- **Dependencies**: Task 8.1.  
- **Risks**: None.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Health check endpoint used by load balancer; latency and error rate metrics; alerts on 5xx spike and auth failure spike.
- [ ] Logging with request id; no PII in logs.

**Estimate**: 1 SP

### Task 8.5 — NotebookLM read-only integration (teaching feed)

**Labels**: Type: Feature | AI: Non-AI | Risk: Medium | Area: Backend — Integration

**Notes**:
- **As a** business layer  
- **I want** to consume daily teaching feed (per-class summaries) from NotebookLM for homework/quiz generation  
- **So that** content is aligned to today's class when available.  
- **Mode**: V2  
- **Type**: Feature  
- **Dependencies**: Task 2.2, 2.3; NotebookLM API/schema TBD.  
- **Risks**: R5 — feed quality; fallback to syllabus-level content; label "today's class" vs "standard syllabus".

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Read-only HTTP integration to NotebookLM (or stub); ingest daily summaries into teaching_feed (or equivalent); business layer uses for generation when available.
- [ ] Fallback when feed missing; no write to NotebookLM; schema/API deferred to integration phase if needed.

**Estimate**: 2 SP

## Risk Register (Planner)

| ID | Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| R1 | AI hallucination / off-syllabus | Ground prompts in syllabus + NotebookLM; validation layer; flag uncertainty in UI | Backend + Frontend |
| R2 | Over-helping | Enforce guidance levels in business layer; full solution gated; UX shows level | Backend + Frontend |
| R3 | Grading fairness | Deterministic scoring for objective; rubric storage; clear explanations | Backend |
| R4 | Data privacy (minors) | Minimize PII to AI; consent; encryption; deletion path | Backend + DevOps |
| R5 | NotebookLM feed quality | Fallback to syllabus-level; label source | Backend |
| R6 | Connectivity / latency | Cache, retry, offline/sync states in UI | Backend + Frontend |
| R7 | MPIN brute-force | Rate limiting, lockout, audit failed attempts | Backend |
| R8 | Attendance accuracy | Read-only for student; label period/source | Backend |

## Forecast Summary

| Sprint | Focus | SP | Confidence |
|--------|--------|-----|------------|
| 1 | Foundation & Auth | 8 | 95% |
| 2 | Data & Backend Core | 8 | 95% |
| 3 | Today's Plan & Activities | 8 | 90% |
| 4 | AI Integration | 8 | 75% (AI probabilistic) |
| 5 | Attendance & Doubts API | 7 | 85% |
| 6 | Client — Login, Home, Activity, Results | 10 | 85% |
| 7 | Client — Attendance, Doubts, Profile | 8 | 85% |
| 8 | DevOps, Security, NotebookLM | 8 | 80% |

**Total**: ~65 SP over 8 sprints. **No scope expansion**; all items trace to Architecture + UX only.

## STANDARD HANDOFF – To Dev Agent

```
============================================
HANDOFF: Planner / Scrum Master AI Agent → Dev Agent
============================================

PROJECT: Mindforge Student Experience

ARTIFACT SOURCE: docs/planning/Mindforge_Student_Experience_Planner_Backlog.md

PLANNING STATUS: Backlog and sprints defined; no architecture or UX changes.

WHAT THE DEV RECEIVES:
- Plan: Mindforge Student Experience — Release 1
- Buckets: Sprints 1–8 (Foundation & Auth → Data Core → Today's Plan & Activities → AI Integration → Attendance & Doubts API → Client Login/Home/Activity/Results → Client Attendance/Doubts/Profile → DevOps & NotebookLM)
- Tasks: Each task has Title, User story (As/I want/So that), Acceptance criteria (Checklist), Dependencies, Risks, Labels (Type | AI/Non-AI | Risk | Area)
- Notes: Full details in each task's Notes block
- Capacity: 1 engineer = 8–10 SP/sprint; 20% buffer; AI work treated as probabilistic (confidence % in forecast)
- Risk register: R1–R8 with mitigations and owner area

CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT BREAK):
- UX is locked (docs/Mindforge_Student_Experience_UX_Design_Specification.md). No screen, flow, or feature changes.
- Architecture is locked (docs/architecture/final/Mindforge_Student_Experience_Technical_Architecture_Final.md). Implement as specified; no new endpoints or layers.
- No scope expansion; only implement approved design.

DEV NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement in sprint order (Sprint 1 → 2 → … → 8) or as directed by PM; respect dependencies in task Notes.
2. Use Checklist per task as acceptance criteria; satisfy all items before marking done.
3. Surface AI uncertainty (timeouts, fallbacks) in UI and logs; use confidence/labels where applicable.
4. Run tests and migrations per CI/CD; adhere to coding standards and security (secrets, rate limit, audit).

BLOCKERS: None.

DEPENDENCIES:
